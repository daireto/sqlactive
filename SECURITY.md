# Security Policy

For security vulnerabilities, **do not open an issue**. Instead,
email [dairoandres123@gmail.com](mailto:dairoandres123@gmail.com).

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask
yourself these two questions:

* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have
  access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably
dealing with a security issue.
Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing
with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email
[dairoandres123@gmail.com](mailto:dairoandres123@gmail.com).
